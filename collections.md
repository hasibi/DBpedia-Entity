===================

The DBpedia-Entity collection has been extended for two other entity-oriented tasks. These collections are developed based on DBpedia 2015-10 and are available for download:

  - [Entity summarization](https://github.com/iai-group/DynamicEntitySummarization-DynES) [1]: 100 query-entity pairs (evenly selected from the four query subsets), their corresponding entity facts, and their graded judgments with respect to importance, relevance, and utility.

  - [Target type identification](https://github.com/iai-group/sigir2017-query_types) [2]: DBpedia-entity queries are annotated with target query types using the DBpedia ontology.
